      <h1>What is consultancy scrum?</h1>
      <div class="line"></div>
      
      <p>Scrum is a framework for a team working together to build a product. Using scrum, a team develops its product in small pieces, with each piece building upon its predecessors. Organizations originally created Scrum and other agile methodologies to manage and develop their own products using their own resources. As a result, they're inward-facing with budgets and resources often managed by a single entity. This can lead to difficulties and misunderstandings when working for an external client.</p>
      <p>Consultancy Scrum is a framework for integrating clients into the Scrum process, making the traditionally inward-facing model an outward-facing process. The key is to make your client the Product Owner.

      <h4>Client as Product Owners</h4>
      <p>In Consultancy Scrum, the Product Owner is someone on the client side. Clients who are new to the Product Owner role will need to learn how to write user stories, how to prioritize them, what to look for in stories, and why accepting stories is important.</p> 
      <p>Most importantly, clients need to understand how something can be “done” when it’s only one piece of the puzzle. It may take some training on the part of the vendor, but an integrated, invested client can be the development team’s greatest resource.

      <h4>Client management</h4>
      <p>When the client is integrated into development, it’s easy to think of them as another member of the team. Remember that they’re still the client and have business and emotional needs that need to be met beyond the scope of the project. </p>
      <p>Appoint an account manager-like point of contact who isn’t purely project focused. This person can have frank discussions with the client to make sure all of their needs are being met without any of the day-to-day project concerns getting in the way.
</p>

      <h4>Pick two</h4>
      <p>Encourage the Product Owner and stakeholders to pick their two highest priorities: Budget, Timeline, or Features. The backlog should always be fine-tuned to meet the most important of the two, allowing the third to be flexible.
      </p> 
      <p>Note: Budget is always one of the two, even if the client says it isn’t. When working for an outside stakeholder, budget is a driver and should be reviewed with the client and team on a consistent basis. This minimizes the risk of surprises. No one wants to run out of money before the project is complete.</p>
